# Overview of Pathwise - HTML5

### Why?
Hello, my name is Hunter Wilhelm and welcome to my portfolio! I am trying to master socket connections by remaking a game from my childhood -- Pathwise. The game is a two-player strategy game.

[Pathwise](https://poptropica.fandom.com/wiki/Pathwise) was originally developed for [Poptropica](https://www.poptropica.com/) under Story Arc Media, Inc.

### How to play
* Create or join a room. The game begins when there are 2 people in a room, so you'll need to invite someone else to play or simply open a different browser profile to simulate the game yourself.
* On your turn, click on any tile to change it to your color. Your goal is to create a pathway that connects the two sides of your color.
* First person to make a path of tiles that connect the sides of their color together wins.
* Follow the instructions if you want to rematch. (The first turn alternates each round).
